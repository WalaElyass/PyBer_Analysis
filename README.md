# PyBer_Analysis

### The purpose of the analysis.

create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type

Urban cities generate the most rides and total fares

Rural generates the lowest rides and total fares

Urban cities have more drivers then Rural and Suburban combined leading Urban to collect the highest total fares

## Summary:


Based on my analysis of the PyBer ride sharing data,The CEO can think about moving some Urban drivers to Rural areas to help and meet the demand of rides. Finally, the CEO should increase the price of fares per ride in Urban areas so that they can keep up with the volume of extra drivers.
